			<h1>INDEVX</h1>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>
				IndevX is a mod for Minecraft Indev 20100223, that focuses on adding nice improvements
				<br>
				and additions in the original style. It looks, and functions like a typical golden age mod, while still
				<br>
				retaining the vanilla Ã¦sthetic, which mods like Indev+, ReIndev etc lost - no blame of course, they are great.
			</p>
			<h2>Download</h2>
			<p>
				The recommended way to play IndevX is through the XUP (pronounced like "zap", stands for "indevX UPdater") launcher
				<br>
				designed specifically for this mod, that lets you automatically update the mod by simply checking a checkbox.
				<br><br>

				<br>
				The launcher contains many options, splashes referencing topics from Star Wars, 1984, OSS and others.<br>
				Download the launcher: 
				<a href="https://glowiak.github.io/p/indevx/xup.jar">jarfile</a> 
				<a href="https://codeberg.org/glowiak/xup">source code</a>
				<br>
				<strong>NOTE: I condemn piracy! This launcher has no MS auth, because it's damn hard to implement, but I will do it some day.<br>
				please don't pirate</strong>
				<br><br>
				If you prefer to use it in a general-use launcher, like PolyMC, download the 
				<a href="https://glowiak.github.io/p/indevx/indevx.jar">jarfile</a> and use it as the game jar.<br>
				Note that with this method you need to update it manually.
