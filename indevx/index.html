			<h1>INDEVX</h1>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>
				IndevX is a mod for Minecraft Indev 20100223, that focuses on adding nice improvements
				<br>
				and additions in the original style. It looks, and functions like a typical golden age mod, while still
				<br>
				retaining the vanilla æsthetic, which mods like Indev+, ReIndev etc lost - no blame of course, they are great.
			</p>
			<h2>Download</h2>
			<p>
				<strike>The recommended way to play IndevX is through the XUP (pronounced like "zap", stands for "indevX UPdater") launcher
				<br>
				designed specifically for this mod, that lets you automatically update the mod by simply checking a checkbox.
				<br><br>

				<br>
				The launcher contains many options, splashes referencing topics from Star Wars, 1984, OSS and others.<br>
				Download the launcher: 
				<a href="https://glowiak.github.io/p/indevx/xup.jar">jarfile</a> 
				<a href="https://codeberg.org/glowiak/xup">source code</a>
				<br>
				<strong>NOTE: I condemn piracy! This launcher has no MS auth, because it's damn hard to implement, but I will do it some day.<br>
				please don't pirate</strong></strike>
				<br><br>
				<strong>The XUP launcher on the Windows platform has a mouse pointer bug. If you use Windows, please use a regular launcher!</strong>
				<br>
				If you prefer to use it in a general-use launcher, like PolyMC, download the 
				<a href="https://glowiak.github.io/p/indevx/indevx.jar">jarfile</a> and use it as the game jar.<br>
				Note that with this method you need to update it manually.<br>
				<strong>You need to add the -Djava.util.Arrays.useLegacyMergeSort=true Java argument, or the game will crash on generating levels!</strong>
			</p>

			<h2>Crafting recipes</h2>

				<br><br>
				<p>Survival in hell is hard, nobody should do it.</p>
				<br>
				
				<img src="stonedebris.png">
				<br><br>
				<p>You'll cry</p>
				<br>
				
				<img src="gate.png">
				<br><br>
				<p>Gates are like doors, but better. And for that betterness you need to pay more.</p>
			<h2>Screenshots</h2>

				<br><br>
				<p>All the new ores that the mod has to offer</p>
				<br>
				
				<img src="newtools.png">
				<br><br>
				<p>All the new tools and weapons</p>
				<br>
			<h2>Silver</h2>
			<br>
			<p>
				Silver is the best ore in the mod. It is as rare, or sometimes even rarer than diamonds.
				<br>
				Silver is a fair metal, which means it cannot generate in hell.
				<br>
				Unlike gold. In Polish the word for "gold" is "złoto", and the word for "evil" is "zło".
				<br>
				Not accidentally there is a saying, that gold and evil have much in common.
				<br>
				Hence, gold is very common in hell. Enjoy, fans of greed (which is a sin!).
				<br>
				Btw, the palms in hell are actually a reference to the fact, that a youtuber named 
				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BANCLAMOFFICIAL">BANCLAM</a> 
				actually built palms in hell.

			<h2>Bug reporting</h2>
			<p>
				Until I have a better way, you can report bugs <a href="https://codeberg.org/glowiak/xup/issues">here</a>.
				<br>
				By reporting bugs you can get them fixed, so please do it.
