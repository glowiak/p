      <h1>My english reform idea</h1>
      <p>
        <b>So, english is a language with dumb spelling, and this is yet another idea to make it bit better, though 100% that it's worse than original</b>
        <br>
        Let's start with the the alphabet:<br>
        Aa - as in 'and'<br>
        AA - double a as in wrongly spelled 'dark'<br>
        Ää - as 'a' in 'cat'<br>
        Bb - as in 'better'<br>
        Cc - ts or tz. never 'k'! (this letter in normal english is pretty useless)<br>
        Dd - as in 'destroy'<br>
        Dh - as 'th' in 'the'<br>
        Ee - as 'a' in 'Alderaan'<br>
        Éé - as 'ea' in 'deal'<br>
        Ff - as in 'Fangtom'<br>
        Gg - hard g as in 'rag'<br>
        Hh - as in 'hidden'<br>
        Ii - as 'y' in 'yes'<br>
        Jj - as 'zh' in 'zhell' or french j<br>
        Kk - as in 'quartz'<br>
        Ll - as in 'low'<br>
        Mm - as in 'mom'<br>
        Nn - as in 'now'<br>
        Ńń - as 'ng' in 'Angmar'<br>
        Oo - as in 'work'<br>
        Óó - as 'o' in 'to'<br>
        Pp - as in 'play'<br>
        Rr - as in 'run'<br>
        Ss - as in 'sand'<br>
        Tt - as in 'touch'<br>
        Th - as in 'thing'<br>
        Uu - as 'oo' in 'too'<br>
        Üü - as 'oo' in 'moon' or the german u-umlaut<br>
        Vv - as in 'very'<br>
        Ww - as in 'wow'<br>
        Xx - as in 'external'<br>
        Yy - as in 'myth'<br>
        Zz - as in 'zenithal'<br><br>And diphtongs:<br>
        
        Sh - as in 'shell'<br>
        Dj - as 'j' in 'join'<br>
        Dz - as 'j' in 'kim jong un'<br>
        
        Each noun (except pronouns) is typed uppercase. The pronouns are slightly adjusted to match new ortography:<br>
        Ei - I<br>
        Iü - you<br>
        Hi - he<br>
        Shi - she<br>
        It - it<br>
        Wé - we<br>
        Dhai - they<br>The 'to be' verb has been adjusted too<br>
        Base form: 'tó bi'<br>
        Ei am<br>
        Iü aa<br>
        Hi, She, It ys<br>
        Wé, Iü, Dhai aa<br>
        
        <br><br><br>
        
        Example sentence:<br>
        Dhe Mün sheins Neit, leitniń ic Daak<br>
        in dhe Daak dhee ys somuon Waak<br><br>Which in current spelling gives:<br>
        The moon shines night, lighting its dark<br>
        in the dark there is someone walk(ing)<br><br><br>
        
        Sou, ei am goiń tó skul, and ei am not hapi wyth dhat. - So, I am going to school, and I am not happy with that.<br>
        Dhedh! Trest mi! Mr. Kät ys an ivil Eilien! - Dad! Trust me!. Mr. Kat is an evil alien!
